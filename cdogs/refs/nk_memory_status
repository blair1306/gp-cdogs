<doc f='codebrowser/src/nuklear/nuklear.h' l='2191'>/*  A basic (double)-buffer with linear allocation and resetting as only
    freeing policy. The buffer&apos;s main purpose is to control all memory management
    inside the GUI toolkit and still leave memory control as much as possible in
    the hand of the user while also making sure the library is easy to use if
    not as much control is needed.
    In general all memory inside this library can be provided from the user in
    three different ways.

    The first way and the one providing most control is by just passing a fixed
    size memory block. In this case all control lies in the hand of the user
    since he can exactly control where the memory comes from and how much memory
    the library should consume. Of course using the fixed size API removes the
    ability to automatically resize a buffer if not enough memory is provided so
    you have to take over the resizing. While being a fixed sized buffer sounds
    quite limiting, it is very effective in this library since the actual memory
    consumption is quite stable and has a fixed upper bound for a lot of cases.

    If you don&apos;t want to think about how much memory the library should allocate
    at all time or have a very dynamic UI with unpredictable memory consumption
    habits but still want control over memory allocation you can use the dynamic
    allocator based API. The allocator consists of two callbacks for allocating
    and freeing memory and optional userdata so you can plugin your own allocator.

    The final and easiest way can be used by defining
    NK_INCLUDE_DEFAULT_ALLOCATOR which uses the standard library memory
    allocation functions malloc and free and takes over complete control over
    memory in this library.
