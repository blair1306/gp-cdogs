<doc f='include/SDL2/SDL_mixer.h' l='324'>/* You may not need to call this explicitly, unless you need to stop all
 *  effects from processing in the middle of a chunk&apos;s playback. Note that
 *  this will also shut off some internal effect processing, since
 *  Mix_SetPanning() and others may use this API under the hood. This is
 *  called internally when a channel completes playback.
 * Posteffects are never implicitly unregistered as they are for channels,
 *  but they may be explicitly unregistered through this function by
 *  specifying MIX_CHANNEL_POST for a channel.
 * returns zero if error (no such channel), nonzero if all effects removed.
 *  Error messages can be retrieved from Mix_GetError().
