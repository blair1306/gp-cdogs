<doc f='include/SDL2/SDL_mixer.h' l='350'>/* Set the panning of a channel. The left and right channels are specified
 *  as integers between 0 and 255, quietest to loudest, respectively.
 *
 * Technically, this is just individual volume control for a sample with
 *  two (stereo) channels, so it can be used for more than just panning.
 *  If you want real panning, call it like this:
 *
 *   Mix_SetPanning(channel, left, 255 - left);
 *
 * ...which isn&apos;t so hard.
 *
 * Setting (channel) to MIX_CHANNEL_POST registers this as a posteffect, and
 *  the panning will be done to the final mixed stream before passing it on
 *  to the audio device.
 *
 * This uses the Mix_RegisterEffect() API internally, and returns without
 *  registering the effect function if the audio device is not configured
 *  for stereo output. Setting both (left) and (right) to 255 causes this
 *  effect to be unregistered, since that is the data&apos;s normal state.
 *
 * returns zero if error (no such channel or Mix_RegisterEffect() fails),
 *  nonzero if panning effect enabled. Note that an audio device in mono
 *  mode is a no-op, but this call will return successful in that case.
 *  Error messages can be retrieved from Mix_GetError().
