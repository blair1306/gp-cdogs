<doc f='codebrowser/src/cdogs/enet/peer.c' l='13'>/** Configures throttle parameter for a peer.

    Unreliable packets are dropped by ENet in response to the varying conditions
    of the Internet connection to the peer.  The throttle represents a probability
    that an unreliable packet should not be dropped and thus sent by ENet to the peer.
    The lowest mean round trip time from the sending of a reliable packet to the
    receipt of its acknowledgement is measured over an amount of time specified by
    the interval parameter in milliseconds.  If a measured round trip time happens to
    be significantly less than the mean round trip time measured over the interval, 
    then the throttle probability is increased to allow more traffic by an amount
    specified in the acceleration parameter, which is a ratio to the ENET_PEER_PACKET_THROTTLE_SCALE
    constant.  If a measured round trip time happens to be significantly greater than
    the mean round trip time measured over the interval, then the throttle probability
    is decreased to limit traffic by an amount specified in the deceleration parameter, which
    is a ratio to the ENET_PEER_PACKET_THROTTLE_SCALE constant.  When the throttle has
    a value of ENET_PEER_PACKET_THROTTLE_SCALE, no unreliable packets are dropped by 
    ENet, and so 100% of all unreliable packets will be sent.  When the throttle has a
    value of 0, all unreliable packets are dropped by ENet, and so 0% of all unreliable
    packets will be sent.  Intermediate values for the throttle represent intermediate
    probabilities between 0% and 100% of unreliable packets being sent.  The bandwidth
    limits of the local and foreign hosts are taken into account to determine a 
    sensible limit for the throttle probability above which it should not raise even in
    the best of conditions.

    @param peer peer to configure 
    @param interval interval, in milliseconds, over which to measure lowest mean RTT; the default value is ENET_PEER_PACKET_THROTTLE_INTERVAL.
    @param acceleration rate at which to increase the throttle probability as mean RTT declines
    @param deceleration rate at which to decrease the throttle probability as mean RTT increases
