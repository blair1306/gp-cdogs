<doc f='include/SDL2/SDL_mixer.h' l='472'>/* Causes a channel to reverse its stereo. This is handy if the user has his
 *  speakers hooked up backwards, or you would like to have a minor bit of
 *  psychedelia in your sound code.  :)  Calling this function with (flip)
 *  set to non-zero reverses the chunks&apos;s usual channels. If (flip) is zero,
 *  the effect is unregistered.
 *
 * This uses the Mix_RegisterEffect() API internally, and thus is probably
 *  more CPU intensive than having the user just plug in his speakers
 *  correctly. Mix_SetReverseStereo() returns without registering the effect
 *  function if the audio device is not configured for stereo output.
 *
 * If you specify MIX_CHANNEL_POST for (channel), then this the effect is used
 *  on the final mixed stream before sending it on to the audio device (a
 *  posteffect).
 *
 * returns zero if error (no such channel or Mix_RegisterEffect() fails),
 *  nonzero if reversing effect is enabled. Note that an audio device in mono
 *  mode is a no-op, but this call will return successful in that case.
 *  Error messages can be retrieved from Mix_GetError().
